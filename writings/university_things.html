            Some Useful University Things
        </h1>
        <p>
            This page contains some useful things I've come across during my time at UofT.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Becoming a teaching assistant</li>
            <li>Making your own website</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
            1. Becoming a teaching assistant.
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you're a student at UofT and you want to become a teaching assistant, you can! The applications are on <a href="https://unit1.hrandequity.utoronto.ca/">this</a> page. I know that the mathematics department hires undergraduates for some of the first year courses. I am not sure about the other departments, but you can always try!
        </p>
        <h2>
          2. Making your own website.
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you're a student at UofT you get free web hosting through UofT! This website is an example of that. The following is how you do so:
            <ol>
              <li>Go <a href="http://sites.utoronto.ca/ns/utorweb/">here</a> and read the FAQ and conditions and use.</li>
              <li>To request the web space you'll be sent to <a href="https://www.utorid.utoronto.ca/">this website</a> (but go through the utorweb website, in the "request web space" section).</li>
              <li>Go to "change options" and login using your utorid.</li>
              <li>There should be a subsection on that page for "Individual Web Space" where you can request web space.</li>
              <li>Within a day you should have a website ready for use!</li>
            </ol>
            To modify your website you'll need to do the following:
            <ol>
              <li>Learn some HTML (and optionally CSS). This shouldn't take too long to learn so don't be intimidated by it! Any tutorial on the internet should be sufficient for basic use. If you want to use the ones I used, go to my "Certificates" page.</li>
              <li>A website works like a file system, just accessible from anywhere. So to change your website you need to change the files in your website's "folder". To do so, do the following:</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>First, go to the same page that you used to request your web space. At the top of the page, you should see a section called "Address for saving (Uploading)".</li>
                  <li>Copy and paste this address into your file explorer and log in.</li>
                  <li>Now you can add, remove, and modify your website's files!
                  <li>Note: The file called index.html will be what a visitor will be brought to when they go to your website's url, so you should always have an index.html file. For example, if you type <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/nathangs/">http://individual.utoronto.ca/nathangs/</a> into your search bar, you will actually be brought to <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/nathangs/index.html">http://individual.utoronto.ca/nathangs/index.html</a>.</li>
                  <li>You may need to clear your web cache to see the changes.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> In most browsers you can view the source code for any webpage you are on. On Windows 10, Firefox, you can do this by right clicking and selecting "View Page Source". You can use this as inspiration! You can also use "Inspect Element" to get a more detailed look.
